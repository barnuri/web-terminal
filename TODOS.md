## Best Practices

### Task Management
1. **Keep tasks atomic** - Each task should be a single, well-defined unit of work
2. **Add context** - Include enough detail for anyone to understand the task
3. **Set priorities** - Use High/Medium/Low to guide work order
4. **Update regularly** - Move tasks through states as work progresses
5. **Archive completed** - Move finished tasks to Completed section weekly

### Task Writing Guidelines
- Use action verbs (Implement, Fix, Update, Refactor, etc.)
- Be specific about what needs to be done
- Include acceptance criteria when applicable
- Link to relevant issues, PRs, or documentation
- Tag with relevant labels (bug, feature, docs, etc.)

### Review Cadence
- **Daily**: Update IN PROGRESS tasks
- **Weekly**: Review and prioritize TODO items
- **Monthly**: Clean up completed tasks and review backlog
