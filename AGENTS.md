## Overview

AI agents are autonomous systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. This document outlines best practices and design patterns for building production-ready AI agent systems in 2025.

### Key Principles
- **Modularity**: Design specialized agents with clear responsibilities
- **Observability**: Maintain visibility into agent decisions and outcomes
- **Reliability**: Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Security**: Protect sensitive data and limit agent access appropriately
- **Scalability**: Build systems that can grow with demand

---

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. **Tool Use Pattern**
Agents interact directly with enterprise systems through APIs, databases, and external services.

**When to use:**
- Retrieving data from external sources
- Calling APIs to execute workflows
- Triggering automated transactions

**Example:**
```typescript
// Agent uses tools to fetch and process data
const agent = new Agent({
  tools: [databaseTool, apiTool, emailTool],
  onToolUse: (tool, params) => validateAndExecute(tool, params)
});
```

### 2. **Reflection Pattern**
Agents evaluate their own work for quality, accuracy, and completeness.

**When to use:**
- Quality assurance workflows
- Self-correcting systems
- Iterative improvement processes

**Implementation:**
- Agent generates output
- Reflection agent reviews output against criteria
- Original agent refines based on feedback

### 3. **Planning Pattern**
Agents break down complex tasks into manageable steps and execute them systematically.

**When to use:**
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Incident response systems
- Project management automation

**Stages:**
1. Intake: Understand the problem
2. Assessment: Evaluate impact and requirements
3. Execution: Follow planned steps
4. Escalation: Handle exceptions

### 4. **Multi-Agent Pattern**
Networks of specialized agents collaborate under an orchestrator.

**When to use:**
- Tasks requiring diverse expertise
- Parallel processing needs
- Complex domain problems

**Architecture:**
```
Orchestrator
    ├── Research Agent
    ├── Analysis Agent
    ├── Implementation Agent
    └── Validation Agent
```

### 5. **Adaptive Reasoning Pattern**
Agents adjust behavior dynamically based on context and feedback.

**When to use:**
- Dynamic environments
- Changing requirements
- Learning systems

**Key Features:**
- Context awareness
- Dynamic strategy selection
- Continuous learning from outcomes

## Architectural Components

### Three-Stage Workflow

```
┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ Perception │────▶│ Reasoning  │────▶│   Action   │
└────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

#### 1. **Perception**
- Input handling from sensors, APIs, user prompts
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Context extraction

#### 2. **Reasoning**
- Decision-making logic
- Strategy selection
- Planning and optimization

#### 3. **Action**
- Execute chosen operations
- Interact with external systems
- Generate outputs

---

## Best Practices

### 1. **Observability**

Implement comprehensive monitoring throughout the agent lifecycle:

- **Logging**: Capture all agent decisions and reasoning
- **Tracing**: Track execution flow across agent interactions
- **Metrics**: Monitor performance, latency, success rates
- **Debugging**: Enable step-by-step execution inspection

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  observability: {
    logLevel: 'debug',
    traceExecution: true,
    captureReasoningSteps: true
  }
});
```

### 2. **Memory Management**

Handle information beyond LLM token limits:

- **Short-term Memory**: Current conversation context
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge base
- **Working Memory**: Task-specific information
- **Episodic Memory**: Past interaction history

### 3. **Error Handling**

Build resilient systems:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await agent.execute(task);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.type === 'RECOVERABLE') {
    await agent.retry(task, { backoff: 'exponential' });
  } else {
    await agent.escalate(error);
  }
}
```

### 4. **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual agent components
- **Integration Tests**: Verify agent interactions
- **Scenario Tests**: Validate end-to-end workflows
- **Red Team Tests**: Challenge system boundaries

### 5. **Documentation**

Maintain clear documentation for:
- Agent capabilities and limitations
- Tool usage and side effects
- Decision-making criteria
- Integration requirements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Orchestration Patterns

#### Sequential Orchestration
```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Result
```
**Use when:** Tasks have clear dependencies and must execute in order

#### Concurrent Orchestration
```
         ┌─ Agent A ─┐
Task ───┼─ Agent B ─┼─→ Aggregator → Result
         └─ Agent C ─┘
```
**Use when:** Multiple perspectives needed or parallel processing beneficial

#### Group Chat Orchestration
```
Orchestrator
    ↓
┌────────────────────┐
│  Agent Discussion  │
│  A ↔ B ↔ C ↔ D    │
└────────────────────┘
    ↓
  Result
```
**Use when:** Collaborative problem-solving or consensus-building needed

#### Handoff Orchestration
```
Task → Router → [Specialized Agent A or B or C] → Result
```
**Use when:** Dynamic routing based on task characteristics required

#### Magentic Orchestration
```
Task → Planning Agent → [Dynamic Agent Selection] → Execution → Refinement
```
**Use when:** Complex, open-ended problems with evolving requirements

## Security & Reliability

### Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Grant minimum necessary permissions
   - Scope tool access appropriately
   - Regular permission audits

2. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Validate tool parameters
   - Prevent injection attacks

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
   - Implement secure credential management
   - Never commit secrets to version control

4. **Agent Isolation**
   - Separate agent environments
   - Limit cross-agent communication
   - Sandbox dangerous operations

### Reliability Patterns

1. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Prevent cascading failures
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Protect external services
   - Prevent resource exhaustion
   - Fair usage policies

3. **Idempotency**
   - Ensure operations can be safely retried
   - Maintain consistency
   - Handle duplicate requests

4. **Fallback Strategies**
   - Default behaviors when agents fail
   - Alternative execution paths
   - Human-in-the-loop escalation
